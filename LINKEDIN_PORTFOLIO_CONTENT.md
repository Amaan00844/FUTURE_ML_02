Support Ticket Classification & Prioritization System
Transforming Customer Support Through Machine Learning

PROJECT OVERVIEW
In today's digital landscape, customer support teams are overwhelmed with ticket volumes. Manual classification wastes thousands of hours, delays critical issues, and frustrates customers. This project delivers an automated, AI-powered solution that revolutionizes the support workflow.

THE PROBLEM
Analyzed a dataset of 47,837 real support tickets representing common challenges:
• 2-3 minutes spent manually categorizing each ticket
• Critical issues buried in the backlog
• Inefficient resource allocation across teams
• Poor customer satisfaction due to slow response times
• Scaling challenges - more customers = need more support staff

Economic Impact:
• 1,993 hours of annual manual labor
• $49,830 in labor costs (at $25/hour)
• Lost customer revenue from poor service
• Agent burnout from repetitive tasks

THE SOLUTION
I built an end-to-end machine learning system that:

1. AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION
Categorizes tickets into 8 distinct categories:
- Hardware (system issues, connectivity)
- Access (login, permissions, authentication)
- HR Support (employee requests)
- Miscellaneous (general inquiries)
- Storage (file management)
- Purchase (procurement)
- Internal Project (project-related)
- Administrative Rights (elevated permissions)

2. INTELLIGENT PRIORITIZATION
Assigns priority levels based on business rules:
- High Priority (47%): Hardware, Access, Admin Rights
- Medium Priority (32%): HR, Purchase, Projects
- Low Priority (21%): Miscellaneous, Storage

3. REAL-TIME PROCESSING
- Sub-second classification time
- Confidence scores for validation
- Top-3 predictions for ambiguous cases
- API-ready for production deployment

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Data Processing Pipeline:
• Text preprocessing (lowercase, digit removal, punctuation cleaning)
• Stop word filtering (English)

## Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about this project"
```
I built a support ticket classification system that solves a real problem many companies face: the overwhelming manual work of categorizing customer support tickets.

The system uses Natural Language Processing and machine learning to automatically classify tickets into 8 categories and assign priority levels - all in under a second.

What makes this particularly valuable is the measurable business impact. The manual process required nearly 2,000 hours of work annually. My automated solution reduces this to about 13 hours, saving roughly $50,000 per year.

From a technical perspective, I evaluated four different algorithms and chose Linear SVM because it achieved the best F1-score of 85.6% while maintaining sub-second inference time. I used TF-IDF for feature extraction with 5,000 optimized features including bigrams.

The system is production-ready and could easily integrate with platforms like Zendesk or Jira.
```

### "What was the biggest challenge?"
```
The biggest challenge was actually the class imbalance in the dataset. Hardware tickets made up 28% of the data while Administrative Rights was only 3.7%. 

I addressed this in several ways:
1. Used stratified train-test split to ensure balanced representation
2. Chose F1-score as my primary metric instead of accuracy
3. Analyzed per-category performance to identify weak spots
4. Considered techniques like SMOTE but found Linear SVM handled imbalance well naturally

The result was that even the smallest category achieved acceptable 70% F1-score, while most categories exceeded 85%.
```

### "How would you improve this?"
```
There are several directions I'd take for enhancement:

Short-term:
• Deploy as a REST API for real-world testing
• Add a feedback loop so the model learns from corrections
• Implement confidence thresholds for human review of uncertain cases

Medium-term:
• Experiment with transformer models like BERT for potential accuracy improvements
• Add sentiment analysis to detect frustrated customers
• Implement multi-language support

Long-term:
• Build ticket volume forecasting to predict busy periods
• Add auto-response for common, simple issues
• Create a clustering component to discover new ticket patterns

But honestly, at 85.6% accuracy with sub-second processing, the current system is already production-ready and would deliver immediate value.
